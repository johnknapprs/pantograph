## I want to help work on _pantograph_ by reviewing issues and PRs

Thanks! We would really appreciate the help!
Feel free to read our document on how to [respond to issues and PRs][responding to prs] and also check out how
to become a [core contributor][core contributor].

## Why did my issue/PR get closed?

* The user later decided not to use _pantograph_
* A workaround was found, making it a low priority for the user
* The user changed projects and/or companies
* A new version of _pantograph_ has been released that fixed the problem

In any case, **a closed issue is not necessarily the end of the story!**
If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.

One of the best ways we can keep _pantograph_ an approachable, stable, and dependable tool is to be deliberate
about how we choose to modify it. If we don't adopt your changes or new feature into _pantograph,_
that doesn't mean it was bad work! It may be that the _pantograph_ philosophy about how to accomplish
a particular task doesn't align well with your approach.
The best way to make sure that your time is well spent in contributing to _pantograph_ is
to **start your work** on a modification or new feature **by opening an issue to discuss the problem or shortcoming with the community**.
The _pantograph_ maintainers will do our best to give early feedback about whether a particular goal
and approach is likely to be something we want to adopt!

## Code of Conduct
