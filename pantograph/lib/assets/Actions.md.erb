# pantograph actions

This page contains a list of all built-in pantograph actions and their available options.

To get the most up-to-date information from the command line on your current version you can also run

```sh
pantograph actions # list all available pantograph actions
pantograph action [action_name] # more information for a specific action
```

You can import another `Pantfile` by using the `import` action. This is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple apps and you want to store a `Pantfile` in a separate folder. The path must be relative to the `Pantfile` this is called from.

```ruby
import './path/to/other/Pantfile'
```

For _pantograph_ plugins, check out the [available plugins](/plugins/available-plugins/) page.
If you want to create your own action, check out the [local actions](/create-action/#local-actions) page.
