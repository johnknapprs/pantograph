## Metrics
 
_pantograph_ tracks a few key metrics to understand how developers are using the tool and to help us know what areas need improvement. No personal/sensitive information is ever collected. Metrics that are collected include: 
 
* The number of _pantograph_ runs
* A salted hash of the app identifier or package name, which helps us anonymously identify unique usage of _pantograph_
 
You can easily opt-out of metrics collection by adding `opt_out_usage` at the top of your `Pantfile` or by setting the environment variable `PANTOGRAPH_OPT_OUT_USAGE`. [Check out the metrics code on GitHub](https://github.com/johnknapprs/pantograph/tree/master/pantograph_core/lib/pantograph_core/analytics)
