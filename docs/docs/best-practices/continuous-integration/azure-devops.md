## Getting Started

TODO
Perform the following steps to automate releasing updates from a VSTS build or release definition:

1. Go to your VSTS or TFS project, click on the **Build** tab, and create a new build definition (the "+" icon) that is hooked up to your project's appropriate source repo
1. Click **Add build step...** and select the necessary tasks to generate your release assets (e.g. Gulp, Cordova Build)

<!-- Now when you build, your app will automatically be published to _App Store Connect_! -->
